                    at Wrigley Field during the winter for the park updating from 2015-2019. I had the opportunity 
                    to work at the Mars candy factoy as well as the Dove ice cream factory. I have installed custom
                    lighting as well as the automated systems used to control the lighting. I have worked at Northwestern

                    high rise construction, retail construction inclding Verison Wireless stores and Whole Foods Market.</p>

                        and boom lifts up to 60' I've used cable pulling machines(tuggers/feeders) in different applications. 
                        I've tested cable, tested newly installed panels and equipment, as well as quality testing older used 
                        gear.</p>
