                        <li>Chicagoland downtown, various dates from 2015 to 2022. Construction Foreman/Electrician responsible for the electrical portion of office remodels/tenant buildouts. I was the first electrician on the job, reviewing prints looking for problems. I would manage a crew of up to 8 electricians and coordinate all the different electrical requirements including: lighting & lighting control including Lutron & Crestron, branch circuiting & outlets, data & network, fire alarm, temperature control, audio visual including TV & sound and security. All work was done to code and was inspected. </li>
                        <li>Wrigley Field, Chicago. Winters from 2015 to 2019. Construction foreman responsible for routing new raceways from distribution to outlet. I planned routes, ordered material, directed manpower and regularly communicated with the other trades to coordinate the work. We installed all the underground raceways, fire pump, lighting including Crestron lighting control system. Work required the use of ariel lifts.</li>
                        <li>Mars Candy, Chicago & Burr Ridge. Fall 2019, Fall 2021. As an electrician I was responsible for new conduit raceways for future machines to be installed. We installed raceways/conduits and pulled 12v/24v/48v/120volt/240volt/480volt wiring for conveyors, pumps, motors, security, fire alarm, lighting, controls, sensors and others. </li>

                <div><h2>Ashburn Power & Light Feb. 2012 through April 2015 Construction Foreman/Electrician/Apprentice</h2>
                    <div><ul><li>Northwestern Medical Research Hospital, Chicago. I learned about the electrical needs of the research labs at Northwestern, and ended up managing 3 lab buildouts. I have experience installing switch-gear and buss-duct in high-rise applications. I managed all phases of the job including: installing new electrical panels, conduit bending of all sizes, branch circuiting & outlets, lighting, data & network cabling and infrastructure, fire alarm, temperature control, audio visual including TV & sound and security. Great care was taken not to disturb patients as the location is a research hospital and quite busy.</li>
                        <li>Verizon Wireless Store Skokie Blvd. I was tasked with maaging the renovation and upgrade of a single to a double wide store. The verizon store started as a single space in a strip mall, they bought the space next door with the intention of creating a whole new space. I needed to install half of an operational Verizon wireless store with future plans to build the second half once the first half was operational. This required careful planning and creative installation to never miss a day. The install was a success and service was provided without interruption.</li></ul>

                <div><ul><li>Chatfield Electric had me working on twin 40 story residential towers downtown Chicago. I was a part of building this structure from the ground up. I helped install everything from lightning protection grounding in the base structure of the building, all the was to installing the lightning protection on the top of th buiding and everything inbetween. I had the unique experience of being at the job before it was a job and seeing the whole process. That was probably one of the most important parts of my apprenticeship and I'm sure not all students have quite the same opportunity, but I am thankful I had this experience helping to educate me on all parts of the constuction trade.</li>

                    these assorted jobs, performed at various locations including inside and out helped me to approach sales

                <p>I have been using technology my whole life. I have realized the significance of adapting
                    to change and getting used to new technology because honestly that's where the future is 
                    leading us, towards a more complicated future. I have experience installing software and hardware,
